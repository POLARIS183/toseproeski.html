<h4> Tose performing a concert in Skopje, 2007. </h4>
<h2>Childhood</h2>
<h5> Proeski was born in Prilep, then-Yugoslavia, on the 25th of January, 1981.<br>At some point, he moved to Krusevo, the highest town in both the country of Yugoslavia (now Macedonia) and the entire Balkan region. At Krusevo, he perfected his singing talent, and was asked to perform at <i>Zlatno Slavejče,</i> a music festival with child singers, where he performed <i>Јаs i mојоt dеdо </i> in Skopje at the age of only 12.</h5>

<h2>Festival Performances</h2>
<h5>After his first official public performance, Tose was widely acclaimed for his strong vocal and musical talent, which spurred him on to perform at <i>Makfest 1997</i> in the city of Štip, singing <i>Pušti Me,</i> which translates as 'Let Me Go'.<br><br> After his popularity at <i>Makfest 1997,</i> Tose used other festivals to grow his fanbase. One of these festivals was <i>SkopjeFest 2000,</i> the Macedonian selection for the <i>Eurovision Song Contest 2000,</i> held in Stockholm, Sweden. The previous year, Proeski had performed his first ever solo concert, and released his debut album, <i>Nekade vo noḱta,</i>, or 'Somewhere in the Night.' <br><br> At SkopjeFest, his song, <i>'Solzi pravat zlaten prsten'</i> came first in the public's popular phone-in vote, but only came third overall, with girl band XXL going to Stockholm. <br> Proeski had previously competed in <i>SkopjeFest,</i> coming eighth in 1998.</h5>

<h5> ABOVE: <i>'Solzi pravat zlaten prsten'</i> being performed at <i>SkopjeFest 2000.</i><br><br> A few months after <i> SkopjeFest 2000</i>, Tose promoted his second album, <i>Sinot Božji,</i> or 'Son of God.' This included <i>"Nemir" ("Restless") (with Karolina Gočeva, who came second in SkopjeFest 2000), "Vo kosi da ti spijam" ("Sleeping in Your Hair"), "Izlaži me ušte ednaš" ("Lie to Me One More Time"), and "Iluzija" ("Illusion")</i></h5>

<h2> Regional Stardom </h2>
<h5> In 2002, Proeski released his third album, singing both in Macedonian and in Serbian. To promote the album, he travelled around North Macedonia, as well as visiting FR Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), Bosnia/Herzegovina and Bulgaria. In April 2003, he looked set to go to the <i>Eurovision Song Contest 2003</i> in Riga, Latvia under the Serbian-Montenegrin flag, as a debut entry. However, due to Albania, Belarus and the Ukraine also wanting to debut, the EBU could only give one country the spot in Riga. <br> That spot went to the Ukraine.<br><br>After his third Eurovision attempt, Proeski went to New York, where he took classes to improve his singing voice from <i>maestro</i> William Riley, who was also coach to famous tenor, Luciano Pavarotti. When Tose came back, he performed a series of humanitarian concerts for charity, and was presented the Mother Teresa Humanitarian Award.<br>Tose played a whopping eight instruments: keyboard, guitar, piano, saxophone, clarinet, bass, guitar and drums </h5>
<h2> Eurovision Song Contest </h2>
<h5> In 2004, Tose was selected by MPT (the leading Macedonian television network) to sing on the Eurovision stage, this time in Istanbul, Turkey. In the specially-made national selection for him, he performed eight songs from his new album, <i>'Den Za Nas'.</i> Out of those, song 5, <i> Angel Si Ti,</i> or 'You are an Angel' won. After the show, <i>Angel Si Ti</i> was translated to English, and renamed <i>'Life'.</i></h5>

<h5> At the Semi-Final, Tose had a warm reception, being given the maximum 12 points from the neighbouring country of Serbia and Montenegro, and qualified for the final by a hair with 71 points, finishing 14 points above the best non-qualifier.<br><br>In the final, Macedonia had a slightly worse outcome with 47 points, with Serbia and Montenegro again giving Tose their 12 points.<br>Macedonia came 14th in the final, their best result overall at the time.<br> The release of the song 'Life' gave him his first ever charting outside of Eastern Europe, when it reached #49 in South Africa.<h5>
<h2> UNICEF </h2>
<h5>In 2004, Tose was named a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, and recorded the song "This World" which then became the official anthem of UNICEF, along with John Lennon's <i>Imagine.</i></h5>

<h5>After Proeski's death, Unicef said that “The children of the country (North Macedonia) have lost a sincere friend in Tose Proeski. Not only did he entertain children with his magical voice, he also spoke out for them and with them. He was his country’s National Ambassador who advocated tirelessly for children.”<h5>
<h2>Final albums</h2>
<h5>For his next album, <i>Po tebe,</i> Tose signed a contract, so that it could be released in Croatian and Slovenian. In order to establish himself on the Croatian-Slovenian stage, he recorded <i>"Krajnje vreme"</i> with Slovenian singer, Anja Rupel. <i>Po tebe</i> is now one of the most popular albums in the Balkans, topping music charts in Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia/Herzegovina.<br>Tose's final album, <i>Igri bez granici,</i> or Games without Borders, was released on August 2007.<br><br>Tose's last concert was held on 5 October 2007 for the Primary Education Project for USAID. (See title photo.) The concert raised tens of thousands of euros for the primary schools of Macedonia. The concert was attended by over 40,000 people and viewed all over the world.<br><br>Proeski's final interwiew was for Macedonian TV network Kanal 5, and can be viewed on Youtube.</h5>
<h2>Death</h2>
<h5>On the A3 motorway in Croatia during the early morning of 16 October 2007, Proeski died in a car crash while he was asleep in the front passenger seat of a VW Toureg driven by Georgij Georgijevski.</h5>

<h2>State Funeral</h2>
<h5>Proeski's body arrived at midnight in Skopje by a Macedonian army helicopter. It was then transported by car to Krusevo, where he grew up.<br>The US embassy in Skopje paid their respects:<br><br>"It is with immense shock and sadness that I learned today of the death of Tose Proeski. My family and I, and the entire US Embassy extend our deepest condolences to Tose’s friends, family and the Macedonian people. You are all in our thoughts and our prayers.<br><br>
Tose touched countless lives in his time with us and provided an excellent example of how much good one person can accomplish. His music and the joy it gave to millions, and the broader inspiration he provided, particularly to young people, live on as a lasting legacy. We were honored to work with him on several projects and marveled at the energy he brought to everything he did. Tose Proeski packed a lifetime of music and joy and caring for others into his far too short life. We mourn his passing but are thankful for all he accomplished and for all that he gave to anyone who encountered him.<br><br>
The loving response that always greeted Tose, whether from a stadium filled with thousands or a small child giving him a stuffed animal gift, was a reflection of Tose’s own love – of life, of music, of his public and of his country.<br><br>
His family, but also Macedonia, has lost an exceptional son."<br><br>
17 October 2007 was then pronounced a national day of mourning in Macedonia.<br>
The three days following his death were pronounced days of mourning in the City of Krusevo.<br><br>
On 17th October, the government organized an official state funeral for Proeski, which included military honour ceremonies by the Ceremonial Guard Battalion of the Macedonian Army (personnel of which conducted an honorary rifle salute) and a military band. The funeral, which was broadcast by MPT, was attended by many delegations from both Macedonia and beyond, including the President Branko Crvenkovski, the Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski, members of the Macedonian Parliament and its President Ljubiša Georgievski and other high-ranking officials, diplomats, representatives of the Red Cross and other organizations. The funeral was also attended by many notable musicians from Macedonia and other countries, including:<br><br> Karolina Gočeva, Kaliopi, Vlado Janevski, Lambe Alabakoski, Elena Risteska, Jovan Jovanov, Martin Vučić, Adrian Gaxha, Tijana Dapčević and her sister Tamara Todevska, Aki Rahimovski (the frontman of Parni valjak), Toni Cetinski, Ceca Ražnatović, Željko Joksimović, Vlado Georgiev and many others.<br><br> As Proeski was an Orthodox Christian, the religious service was held by the Macedonian Orthodox Church led by the Archbishop Stephen of Ohrid.
